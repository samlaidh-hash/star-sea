# Star Sea - Development Session Memory
**Session Start:** 2025-10-02 12:00:00
**Status:** Resuming Development

## Previous Session Summary
Completed Phases 1-3:
- ✓ Core Engine & Rendering
- ✓ Physics & Movement Systems
- ✓ Combat & Weapons Systems

## Current Session
Conducted comprehensive codebase analysis to prevent duplicate code creation.

### Analysis Completed
✓ Read Shield.js - Full implementation found
✓ Read InternalSystems.js - Full implementation found
✓ Read AIController.js - Full implementation found
✓ Read Disruptor.js - Partial implementation found
✓ Read Ship.js - Systems fully integrated
✓ Read Engine.js - Shield/System events integrated, AI NOT integrated
✓ Read config.js - All Phase 4 & 5 constants present

### Updated CLAUDE.md
Added Code Replacement & Refactoring Rules section with critical workflow:
- Never create duplicate code
- Always analyze existing codebase first
- Comment out old code before replacing
- Update all dependencies and children when replacing code

## Critical Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Integrated Weapons into InternalSystems ✓
**Problem:** Beam batteries and torpedo launchers were not damageable subsystems

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `weapons` array to `SystemManager` constructor (InternalSystems.js:282)
2. Added `setWeapons()` method to link weapons after creation (InternalSystems.js:288-290)
3. Updated `getAllSystems()` to include weapons (InternalSystems.js:303)
4. Modified `Ship.js` constructor to link weapons to systems (Ship.js:50-53)
5. Removed duplicate weapon update loop from Ship.js (line 444)

**Result:** Weapons now included in damage distribution and can be destroyed

### Fix 2: Implemented Auto-Repair System ✓
**Problem:** Auto-repair (0.03 HP/sec) was spec'd but not implemented

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `update()` method to `InternalSystem` base class (InternalSystems.js:34-39)
2. Updated `WarpNacelles.update()` to call `super.update()` (InternalSystems.js:105)
3. Updated `SystemManager.update()` to call update on all systems (InternalSystems.js:323-329)
4. Added `autoRepair()` method to `Weapon` base class (Weapon.js:51-55)
5. Updated `Weapon.update()` to call auto-repair (Weapon.js:65-69)
6. Updated `BeamWeapon.update()` to call `super.update()` (BeamWeapon.js:59)
7. Updated `TorpedoLauncher.update()` to call `super.update()` (TorpedoLauncher.js:57)

**Result:** All systems and weapons now auto-repair at 0.03 HP/sec when HP > 0

### Fix 3: Corrected Disruptor Weapon Specs ✓
**Problem:** Disruptor implemented as burst-fire (4 shots, 1.5s recharge) instead of continuous fire (2s cooldown)

**Changes Made:**
1. Commented out old burst-fire implementation in Disruptor.js (lines 12-22)
2. Rewrote Disruptor as simple cooldown-based weapon (lines 24-81)
3. Changed from `shotsRemaining` to `cooldown` system
4. Now uses `CONFIG.DISRUPTOR_RECHARGE` (2 seconds) correctly
5. Added `getCooldownPercentage()` for HUD display

**Result:** Disruptor now matches original spec - continuous fire with 2-second cooldown

## Phase 4 Polish - HUD Enhancements ✓

### Added Weapon HP Display
**Problem:** Weapons track HP but it wasn't visible in HUD

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated HTML to add weapon HP display to each weapon item (index.html:49-77)
2. Added `.weapon-item` wrapper around weapon bars
3. Added `.weapon-hp` elements showing HP values (e.g., "HP: 4/4")

**Result:** All weapons now show HP below their charge/count displays

### Added Visual Damage Indicators
**Problem:** No visual feedback when weapons/systems are damaged

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated `HUD.js` with `updateWeaponHP()` method (HUD.js:179-197)
2. Added damage state tracking to weapon updates (HUD.js:63-84)
3. Updated CSS with damage indicator classes (hud.css:83-143):
   - `.weapon-item.damaged` - Red text when HP = 0
   - `.weapon-item.warning` - Yellow text when HP ≤ 30%
   - Normal green when HP > 30%

**Result:** Weapons and systems change color based on damage state:
- **Green** (normal) - HP > 30%
- **Yellow** (warning) - HP ≤ 30%
- **Red** (destroyed) - HP = 0

### Auto-Repair Visual Feedback
**Result:** HP values now update in real-time as auto-repair (0.03 HP/sec) restores systems

---

## Phase 5: AI & Enemy Behavior - IN PROGRESS

### Priority 1: Basic AI Combat Integration ✓ COMPLETE

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `enemyShips` array to Engine.js (Engine.js:30)
2. Created `spawnTestEnemies()` method (Engine.js:277-302):
   - Spawns 3 test enemies (Trigon CL, Scintilian CA, Pirate FG)
   - Instantiates AIController for each enemy
3. Integrated AI update in game loop (Engine.js:328-334)
4. Added AI cleanup to `cleanupEntities()` (Engine.js:453)
5. Added AI event handlers (Engine.js:207-229):
   - `ai-fired-beams` - Adds AI beam projectiles
   - `ai-fired-torpedoes` - Adds AI torpedo projectiles
   - `ai-deploy-decoy` - Deploys AI decoys
6. Added AIController.js to index.html (index.html:184)

**Result:** Enemy ships now spawn, patrol, detect player, and engage in combat

**Result:** Enemy ships now spawn, patrol, detect player, and engage in combat

### Priority 2: Trigon Disruptor Weapons ✓ COMPLETE

**Changes Made:**
1. Created `DisruptorProjectile` class (Projectile.js:150-187):
   - Extends Projectile base class
   - Speed: CONFIG.DISRUPTOR_SPEED (800 px/sec = 2x torpedo speed)
   - Damage: 2 (from CONFIG.DISRUPTOR_DAMAGE)
   - Range: Same as beams (20 ship lengths)
   - Straight-line projectile (no homing)
2. Added Disruptor.js to index.html (index.html:194)

**Result:** Disruptor projectiles can now be fired and will damage targets

### Priority 3: Faction-Specific Weapon Loadouts ✓ COMPLETE

**Changes Made:**
1. Rewrote `Ship.createWeapons()` to support all factions (Ship.js:56-180):
   - **PLAYER (Federation):** 2x Beams (3-shot, 270° arc) + 2x Torpedoes (90° arc)
   - **TRIGON (Klingon):** 1-2x Disruptors (2 dmg, 120° arc, 2s cooldown)
     - BC class gets aft disruptor, other classes only forward
   - **SCINTILIAN (Romulan):** 2x Beams (2-shot instead of 3, 270° arc)
     - Plasma torpedoes marked as TODO (Priority 4)
   - **PIRATE (Tholian):** 1x Beam (3-shot, 270° arc) + 1x Torpedo (90° arc)

   - Hit flash effect (0.5s visible when damaged)
   - `getVisibilityAlpha()` - returns 0-1 for rendering
   - `canFireWeapons()` - prevents firing while cloaked

2. Added to Scintilian ships (Ship.js:228-240):
   - All Scintilian ships get cloaking device
   - Same HP as sensors (6 HP)
   - Integrated into SystemManager

3. Updated Ship.js methods (Ship.js:558-574, 685-708):
   - `canFireWeapons()` - checks cloak state
   - `isCloaked()` - helper method
   - `takeDamage()` - calls `cloak.onHit()` for flash
   - NO shields while cloaked

4. Updated rendering (ShipRenderer.js:11-53):
   - `getVisibilityAlpha()` - checks cloak alpha
   - Ships fade to invisible (alpha = 0)
   - Flash visible when hit (alpha based on flash time)
   - Shields not rendered while cloaked

5. Updated targeting (TargetingSystem.js:62-81):

   - Starts with 30 DP (Damage Potential)
   - Degrades at 1 DP/sec (min 10 DP)
   - Speed: 2/3 of normal torpedoes
   - Homing behavior (fire-and-forget)
   - `takeDamage()` - reduces DP when hit by weapons
   - `getBlastRadius(target)` - calculates radius based on DP and target size
     - Formula: `targetSize × (0.50 + (DP × 0.05))`
     - At 30 DP: 150% of target size
     - At 10 DP: 50% of target size

2. Created `PlasmaTorpedo` weapon class (PlasmaTorpedo.js:1-82):
   - 1 plasma torpedo per launcher (vs 4 normal torpedoes)
   - 8-second reload (2x normal torpedo reload)
   - No stored plasma torps

   - 90° firing arc each
   - Integrated into weapon systems

4. Updated Ship.fireTorpedoes() (Ship.js:632-645):
   - Now checks `instanceof PlasmaTorpedo` in addition to TorpedoLauncher

5. Updated Engine collision handler (Engine.js:424-448):
   - Special plasma damage application:
     - Full DP applied to shields first
     - Blast damage (50% DP) applied to all entities in radius
     - Blast damage bypasses shields (direct hull damage)
   - Breaks asteroids in blast radius

6. Added PlasmaTorpedo.js to index.html (index.html:195)

**Result:** Scintilian ships fire plasma torpedoes that degrade over time and deal massive area damage
