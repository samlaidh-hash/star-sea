================================================================================
2. MISSION TYPES & DESCRIPTIONS
================================================================================

Each craft type supports different mission types. Select and launch using the
key bindings described in Section 3.


--- MISSION TYPE: ATTACK ---

Available For: Shuttles, Fighters, Bombers, Drones

Description:
The craft hunts and destroys the nearest enemy ship. It will pursue targets
across the map, using all available weapons (beams for all, torpedoes for
bombers). Drones will use their jamming ability when attacking.

Behavior:
1. Scan for nearest enemy ship within detection range
2. Intercept and close distance
3. Open fire when target enters weapon range
4. Return to patrol around player ship if no enemies found

Tactical Notes:
- First press of mission key = Select ATTACK mission
- Second press of mission key = Launch craft with ATTACK mission
- Craft will stay in combat until target destroyed or they take heavy damage
- For drones: Each hit jams target's beams for 0.3s

Best Scenarios:
- One-on-one duels with enemy fighters/bombers
- Softening up stronger enemies before main ship engages
- Clearing smaller targets away from battle area


--- MISSION TYPE: DEFENSE ---

Available For: Shuttles, Fighters, Bombers, Drones

Description:
The craft orbits your ship and intercepts incoming threats. It will attack
enemy ships, torpedoes, and other hostile craft that come within its patrol
radius. Prioritizes multiple threats intelligently.

Behavior (by craft type):
Shuttle:   Patrols 100-150 pixel radius, intercepts torpedoes and shuttles
Fighter:   Orbits 100 pixel radius, intercepts torpedoes and nearby ships
Bomber:    Heavy patrol 150 pixel radius, prioritizes torpedoes then ships
Drone:     Tight orbit 70 pixel radius, intercepts torpedoes and fighters

Threat Priority:
1. Enemy Torpedoes (highest priority)
2. Enemy Shuttles/Fighters/Drones (medium priority)
3. Enemy Ships within defense radius (low priority)

Tactical Notes:
- Multiple DEFENSE craft create a screen around your ship
- Bombers best for stopping large targets
- Fighters best for torpedo interception
- Drones jam enemy beams while defending

Best Scenarios:
- When heavily outnumbered
- To protect ship during vulnerable maneuvers
- Against torpedo-heavy enemies
- To create a defensive umbrella during fleet engagement


--- MISSION TYPE: WILD_WEASEL ---

Available For: Shuttles, Drones (Not available for Fighters/Bombers)

Description:
The craft flies away from your ship at high speed while emitting signals
that attract enemy torpedoes. Acts as a decoy/distraction to reduce enemy
fire on your main ship.

Behavior:
1. Accelerate away from player ship in its current facing direction
2. Emit strong electronic signals every 0.5 seconds
3. Redirect nearby torpedoes to lock onto drone instead of ship
4. Maintain distance to stay alive while drawing fire

Tactical Notes:
- Expendable role - craft will likely be destroyed
- Best used when expecting heavy torpedo attacks
- Shuttles have more HP (2) so last longer than drones (1)
- Enemy torpedoes locked onto wild weasel leave main ship undefended
- Multiple wild weasels can overload enemy targeting systems

Best Scenarios:
- Pre-battle before heavy missile barrage
- Emergency use when getting hammered by torpedoes
- Multi-ship battles with coordinated enemy fire


--- MISSION TYPE: SUICIDE (Kamikaze) ---

Available For: Shuttles, Bombers (Only these two can perform ramming attacks)

Description:
The craft charges at the nearest enemy at maximum speed and rams them,
exploding with significant force. On impact, produces 2 heavy torpedoes
worth of explosive damage.

Behavior:
1. Locate nearest enemy ship
2. Accelerate to 150% normal thrust (maximum speed boost)
3. Ram target at high velocity
4. Detonate: Explodes as 2 Heavy Torpedoes (4 damage total)
5. Self-destructs

Tactical Notes:
- Craft is lost after impact (intentional)
- Creates 2 Heavy Torpedoes with lock-on capability
- Heavy explosive damage to target (equivalent to 2x torpedo hits)
- Best used against heavily armored targets
- Bomber suicide: More effective due to larger payload

Best Scenarios:
- Emergency strike against high-priority target
- Finishing damaged enemies without using ship resources
- Breaking through enemy formations
- Last-ditch effort when ship is losing badly


--- MISSION TYPE: SCAN ---

Available For: Shuttles (Only mission type)

Description:
The shuttle flies to a designated scan location and performs a deep sensor
scan of the area. Reveals all hidden objects, enemy positions, and mission
objectives within the scan zone.

Behavior:
1. Fly to designated target location (selected by player reticle position)
2. Once within 50 pixels of target, begin scanning
3. Scan takes 10 seconds to complete
4. After scan complete, return to player ship automatically
5. Land on player ship to be recovered

Tactical Notes:
- Scan radius: Approximately 100 pixels around shuttle position
- Reveals cloaked ships in scan zone (Scintilian faction)
- Shows hidden enemies/objectives on HUD
- Does NOT engage in combat during scan
- Shuttle may be attacked while scanning (needs DEFENSE cover)

Best Scenarios:
- Revealing enemy fleet positions before engagement
- Finding hidden objectives for mission victories
- Locating cloaked enemy ships
- Reducing uncertainty in tactical situations


--- MISSION TYPE: TRANSPORT ---

Available For: Shuttles (Only mission type)

Description:
The shuttle carries cargo/personnel to a designated location, waits, and
returns. Used for mission objectives like delivering supplies, evacuating
personnel, or establishing remote positions.

Behavior:
1. Fly to designated target location (shown on map)
2. Upon arrival (within 50 pixels), begin cargo transfer (5 seconds)
3. After transfer complete, return to player ship
4. Land on player ship to complete mission

Tactical Notes:
- Transport is vulnerable during cargo transfer phase
- Consider DEFENSE escort if hostile forces nearby
- May not always be selectable (depends on mission objectives)
- Complete transport mission = Objective progress toward mission win

Best Scenarios:
- Completing mission objectives
- Evacuating survivors
- Establishing supply depots
- Coordination with allied forces

================================================================================
5. SPECIAL MECHANICS
================================================================================

Three advanced systems add depth to craft operations: jamming, probe sensors,
and the ping system.


5.1 JAMMING MECHANICS
================================================================================

DRONE JAMMING (Trigon Faction Primary Advantage)

What is Jamming?
When a Drone fires its beam weapon and hits an enemy SHIP (not other craft):
- The hit triggers a jamming effect
- The target ship's beam weapon cooldown increases by 0.3 seconds
- Effect applies to ALL beam weapons on the target ship
- Effects stack: Multiple drone hits = Multiple cooldown delays

Jamming Mechanics Details:
- ONLY effective against SHIPS (not other fighters/shuttles/drones)
- Adds delay to the weapon's lastFireTime counter
- Multiple drones can jam same target for compounding effect
- Jamming is SILENT - no visual effect (just beam cooldown increases)
- Non-Drones: Do NOT have jamming ability

Tactical Applications:

Single Drone Jamming:
- Launch Drone with ATTACK mission
- Let drone engage enemy ship for 10+ seconds
- Result: Enemy beams fire 0.3s slower than normal
- Effectiveness: Minimal for solo drone

Multi-Drone Jamming:
- Launch 2+ Drones on same target
- Each drone adds 0.3s separately
- 3 Drones = 0.9s total additional cooldown
- Result: Significant firepower reduction on target
- Effectiveness: High for coordinated drone swarms

Combo Strategy - Drone Jamming + Bomber Assault:
1. Launch 2-3 Drones with ATTACK mission
2. Wait 5-10 seconds for jamming to stack
3. Launch Bomber with ATTACK mission
4. Enemy ship can barely fire back
5. Bomber tears through crippled enemy

Enemy Drone Jamming (When Enemy Uses Drones):
- You will notice your beams firing slower than usual
- Check system performance - is it lag, or are you jammed?
- Counter: Employ DEFENSE shuttles/fighters to intercept drones
- Or: Use ship's defenses to destroy enemy drones quickly

Limitations:
- Requires direct hits (beams must connect)
- Only affects beam weapons (not torpedoes)
- Duration is temporary (only applies to immediate next shot)
- Not effective vs. other craft (only vs. ships)


5.2 PROBE SENSOR EXTENSION
================================================================================

What is Probe Sensor Extension?

Probes extend your ship's sensor range along their flight path. They are
unmanned, unarmed reconnaissance units designed to extend your detection
capabilities beyond your main ship's sensor range.

Probe Statistics (For Reference):
- Speed: 100% of player ship speed (keeps up with you)
- Acceleration: 150% (quick to reach waypoint)
- Maneuverability: 200% turn rate (can redirect en route)
- HP: 1 (destroyed by any hit)
- Shields: 0 (no protection)
- Weapons: NONE - cannot attack

Probe Mission Phases:

APPROACH PHASE (Phase 1):
- Launch probe toward reticle position
- Probe flies toward target location
- Extends sensor coverage cone behind it
- Takes 20-30 seconds to reach distant targets
- Any collision destroys probe (even asteroids)

TARGET REACHED (Phase 2):
- Once within 50 pixels of target, phase changes to EXTENDING
- Probe continues flying past target for 10 more seconds
- Maximum sensor coverage achieved
- Console: "Probe reached target, continuing for 10 seconds..."

EXTENDING PHASE (Phase 3):
- Probe flies in straight line for 10 seconds after target
- Continues to extend sensor coverage
- Trajectory: Same direction as when target was reached
- This extension reveals cloaked ships and hidden objectives

EXPIRED PHASE (Phase 4):
- After 10 seconds of extending, probe self-destructs
- Emits event: "Probe destroyed (mission complete)"
- No longer extends sensor coverage
- Bay space is freed for recovery

Sensor Coverage Details:

Detection Area:
- Line from player ship to probe current position
- Radius: 100 pixels around probe (detection circle)
- Distance: Up to probe's flight range (no hard limit)
- Objects Detected:
  * Enemy ships (even cloaked ones in range)
  * Hidden objectives for missions
  * Environmental hazards (asteroids, pulsars)
  * Enemy torpedoes in flight
  * Other hostile craft

Mission Victory Integration:
Probes can trigger mission victory conditions by:
- Approaching designated scan objectives
- Emitting proximity events for mission system
- Revealing hidden target locations
- Allowing main ship to reach objectives with full information

Tactical Usage:

Reconnaissance Mission:
1. Identify suspect area on map
2. Point reticle at suspicious location
3. Press L to launch probe
4. Probe flies over area, revealing all objects
5. Enemy fleet positions become visible
6. Plan main ship attack with full intelligence

Cloaked Ship Detection:
1. Know enemy Scintilian ships are in area
2. Launch probe toward estimated hiding location
3. If probe passes near cloaked ship, it becomes visible
4. Allows targeting of previously hidden enemies
5. Can coordinate attack with other craft

Objective Scanning:
1. Mission requires scanning an object at distance
2. Launch probe toward objective location
3. Probe passes within detection radius
4. Mission system registers: "Objective detected"
5. Contributes toward mission victory condition

Pre-Battle Scouting:
1. Before major engagement, launch probe toward enemy fleet
2. Gather full intelligence on enemy composition
3. See enemy destroyer? Launch extra drones for jamming
4. See enemy bombers? Launch fighters for interception
5. Make informed strategic decisions

Probe Limitations:

Vulnerability:
- Destroyed by ANY hit (including asteroid collision)
- No shields or armor
- Enemy can shoot down probes to prevent scanning
- Short mission time (20 seconds approach + 10 seconds extending)

Single Coverage:
- Only one probe mission reveals one area
- Multiple probes needed for full map coverage
- Bay space limited - can't launch infinite probes
- Recovery time between probes

Range Limits:
- Must be able to see target location with reticle
- Target beyond sensor range = can't see where to aim
- Off-screen targets impossible to probe
- Limited to visual map area


5.3 PING SYSTEM
================================================================================

What is the Ping System?

The Ping system is a advanced tactical tool (currently placeholder - full
implementation pending). When activated, it broadcasts an active sonar pulse
that reveals enemy positions and threats to you visually.

Current Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Key: P (Press P to activate)
- Effect: Console message - "Ping activated (placeholder)"
- Future Feature: Full implementation in later development phase

Intended Mechanics (When Fully Implemented):

Ping Behavior:
- Activation: Press P during gameplay
- Broadcast Range: Extends to your sensor detection range
- Effect: Sends out directional sonar pulse
- Duration: Instantaneous scan with 5-second cooldown

Information Revealed:
- Enemy ship positions (distance and bearing)
- Enemy torpedo trajectories (incoming threats)
- Hidden objectives in proximity
- Environmental hazards
- Friendly craft status

Tactical Applications (Planned):

Passive Detection Replacement:
- Allows active detection instead of passive sensors
- Risk: May alert nearby enemies of your location
- Reward: Instant full tactical picture

Cloaked Ship Detection:
- Ping can temporarily "light up" cloaked targets
- Makes positioning cloaked ambush attack risky
- Players must balance detection vs. stealth

Emergency Response:
- Quick ping to assess unexpected threat
- No time to visually scan area
- Get immediate threat assessment
- Adjust formation/vector accordingly

Target Area Search:
- Ping to find specific targets
- Instead of visual search across map
- Faster than probe launch for quick intel
- Trade bay space for faster response

Current Placeholder Status:

The ping system is currently marked as TODO in the codebase:
"TODO: Implement ping system in Phase 9"

This means:
- Basic key binding works (P key)
- Console message appears when activated
- No actual game effects occur yet
- Full implementation planned for future update

Workarounds Until Full Implementation:

Until ping is fully implemented, use:
1. Probe launches (L key) - Actual sensor extension
2. Visual scanning - Pan camera around area
3. TAB target cycling - Find enemies methodically
4. Fighter scouts - Send fighters on RECON mission
5. Passive sensors - Wait for enemies to enter detection range

6. TACTICAL GAMEPLAY TIPS
================================================================================

Mastering the shuttle system requires understanding craft strengths,
weaknesses, and synergies. This section provides strategic guidance.


TIP 1: ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS CRAFT BALANCE
================================================================================

The three combat craft types form a tactical triangle:

FIGHTER → beats → SHUTTLE → beats → BOMBER → beats → FIGHTER

Translation:
- Fighter wins 1v1 vs. Shuttle (speed + maneuverability)
- Shuttle can flee from Bomber (faster when damaged)
- Bomber destroys Fighter (armor + torpedoes)

Implication:
- Don't fight Fighter with Shuttle alone
- Launch multiple Shuttles to overwhelm individual Fighter
- Send Fighters to intercept Bombers
- Use Bombers to break Fighter formations

Advanced Exploitation:
- If enemy has Fighters, launch Bombers defensively
- If enemy has Bombers, launch Fighters for intercept
- If enemy has Shuttles, either Fighter or Bomber works
- Force them to counter your counter (mind games!)

Tournament Matchups (1v1 Assumption):
- Fighter > Shuttle (2 out of 3 times)
- Bomber > Fighter (2 out of 3 times)
- Shuttle > Bomber (2 out of 3 times)


TIP 2: CRAFT FORMATION TACTICS
================================================================================

Single Craft Strategy:
- Scout mission (Fighter RECON)
- Diversion (Shuttle WILD_WEASEL)
- Emergency strike (Shuttle SUICIDE)
Weakness: Can be destroyed quickly if focused

Twin Craft Strategy (2 Fighters or 2 Shuttles):
- One attacks, one supports
- Can concentrate fire or scatter enemy focus
- Good for 1v2 opponent engagements
Best For: Fighting medium-strength enemies

Swarm Tactics (3+ Fighters):
- Overwhelm single target through numbers
- Each Fighter deals 0.5 damage - 3 deal 1.5 damage
- Enemy can't evade all three simultaneously
- Very effective vs. enemy Bombers
Best For: Destroying priority targets quickly

Mixed Formations:
- 1 Bomber + 2 Fighters = Heavy support + mobility
- 3 Shuttles + 1 Fighter = Flexibility + speed
- 2 Bombers + 1 Defense craft = Offense + support
Best For: Balanced gameplay, adapting to threats

Defense Screen:
- Circle around player ship at 70-100 pixel radius
- Intercept all incoming threats
- Requires launching multiple DEFENSE craft
- 2+ defensive craft very effective
Best For: Heavily outnumbered scenarios


TIP 3: MISSION SELECTION STRATEGY
================================================================================

BEFORE COMBAT:
1. Scout with Probe (L key) or Fighter RECON
2. Identify threat type (Fighters? Bombers? Torpedoes?)
3. Launch craft to counter threat
4. Position ship for main engagement

AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY:
- Launch Bomber with ATTACK on high-priority target
- Follow with Fighter swarm (2-3 Fighters) on same target
- Shuttle WILD_WEASEL to distract remaining enemies
- Main ship targets weakened secondary target

DEFENSIVE STRATEGY:
- Launch Shuttles + Fighters with DEFENSE mission
- Create defensive bubble around ship
- Interceptors on incoming torpedoes
- Drones jamming enemy beams
- Wait for reinforcements or to repair

TACTIC LAYERING STRATEGY:
Layer 1: Probe reveals enemy position (L key)
Layer 2: Fighters drawn out to intercept probe
Layer 3: Bombers attack concentrated enemy fighters
Layer 4: Main ship engages weakened enemy capital ship

TIP 4: RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Bay Space is LIMITED. Plan craft deployment:

Frigate (FG): 2 spaces
- Option A: 2 Shuttles
- Option B: 1 Bomber (uses 2 spaces, no other craft)
- Recommendation: 2 Shuttles for flexibility

Destroyer (DD): 3 spaces
- Option A: 3 Shuttles (most flexible)
- Option B: 1 Fighter + 1 Shuttle
- Option C: 1 Bomber + 1 Shuttle
- Recommendation: 3 Shuttles (covers all mission types)

Light Cruiser (CL): 4 spaces
- Option A: 4 Shuttles (maximum flexibility)
- Option B: 1 Fighter + 3 Shuttles
- Option C: 2 Fighters + 2 Shuttles (balanced)
- Option D: 1 Bomber + 2 Shuttles
- Recommendation: 2 Fighters + 2 Shuttles (good balance)

Heavy Cruiser (CA): 5 spaces
- Option A: 2 Fighters + 1 Shuttle + 1 Bomber (2 spaces) = 5
- Option B: 3 Fighters + 1 Shuttle + ? = 5
- Option C: 1 Bomber + 3 Shuttles = 5
- Recommendation: 2 Fighters + 1 Bomber + 1 Shuttle (all mission coverage)

Battlecruiser (BC): 6 spaces
- Maximum flexibility - can deploy any combination
- Suggested: 2 Fighters + 1 Bomber + 3 Shuttles (balanced fleet)
- Or: Fighter-heavy, Shuttle-heavy, or Bomber-heavy per mission

Capital Ships (BB/DN/SD): 7-9 spaces
- Deploy mixed formations for any situation
- Recommend: Varied craft for flexibility


TIP 5: CONSUMABLE TIMING
================================================================================

Consumable management separates good players from great ones:

EARLY MISSION PHASE (First 20%):
- DO save consumables - don't use yet
- Monitor damage - shields should be holding
- Plan for tougher battles ahead
- Exceptions: Shield Boost if taking unexpected hits

MID MISSION PHASE (40-60%):
- Monitor health trends
- If shields low: Use Shield Boost before next big fight
- If torpedoes expended: Use Extra Torpedoes to reload
- If mines low: Use Extra Mines for area defense

LATE MISSION PHASE (Last 30%):
- Know mission win condition
- Use consumables to ensure victory
- Heavy damage = Hull Repair Kit + Shield Boost combo
- Low on key ammo = Consumables to top off

EMERGENCY USAGE:
- Under 30% HP: Use Hull Repair Kit immediately
- Under 50% shields: Use Shield Boost + Energy Cells for offense
- Critical systems damaged: Hull Repair Kit buys time
- Final boss fight: Save for end-game emergency


TIP 6: SYNERGISTIC CRAFT COMBINATIONS
================================================================================

Drone Jamming Combo:
1. Launch 2 Drones with ATTACK mission
2. Let them damage enemy ship for 10 seconds
3. Accumulated jamming: -0.6s beam cooldown
4. Launch Bomber with ATTACK
5. Bomber fires at full rate while enemy struggles

Interception Combo:
1. Launch Shuttle with DEFENSE mission
2. Launch Fighter with DEFENSE mission
3. Create overlapping defense radius
4. Nearly all incoming threats intercepted
5. Ship can focus on main target

Scout-Strike Combo:
1. Launch Fighter with SCAN mission
2. Fighter scouts ahead, reveals enemy positions
3. Launch Bombers based on detected threats
4. Bombers know exactly where to strike
5. No wasted ordnance on empty space

Sacrifice-Swarm Combo:
1. Launch Shuttle with WILD_WEASEL
2. Shuttle draws fire away from main ship
3. Launch Bomber ATTACK on now-focused enemy
4. Enemy occupied with Shuttle = exposed to Bomber
5. Shuttle likely destroyed but Bomber gets free hits


TIP 7: DAMAGE OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

Maximum Damage Chain:
1. Jam enemy with Drones (if available) - reduces enemy output
2. Launch Bombers on priority target - high damage output
3. Concentrate Fighter swarm - fast burst damage
4. Use Consumable: Energy Cells for +20% beam damage
5. Main ship joins bombing run
6. Total damage: Very high

Sustained Damage:
- Keep ATTACK craft continuously engaged
- Use consumables: Extra Torpedoes to maintain ammunition
- Protect craft with DEFENSE escort
- Rotate fresh craft in as others are damaged
- Grind down enemy over time

Burst Damage:
- Activate Energy Cells consumable
- Launch all available Bombers simultaneously
- Concentrate all beam fire on one target
- Overwhelm enemy before they can respond
- Requires coordination and timing


TIP 8: SURVIVAL AND RETREAT
================================================================================

Damage Control While Under Attack:
1. Activate DEFENSE craft to reduce incoming damage
2. Maneuver ship to protect shields
3. Use consumables: Hull Repair Kit if critical
4. Launch Drones to jam enemy beams
5. Consider Emergency Stop (X key) to reposition

Craft Recovery:
- Damaged craft return to ship to recover
- Shuttle repair rate: 1 HP per 60 seconds (slow)
- Fighter/Bomber return on low HP (auto-recover)
- Drone cannot recover (fragile, destroyed easily)
- Probe cannot recover (self-destructs)

Strategic Retreat:
1. If outnumbered 3:1 or worse, consider tactical withdrawal
2. Launch WILD_WEASEL to distract enemy
3. Launch Probe (L key) to extend sensor range during retreat
4. Chart course to avoid dangerous areas
5. Regroup and prepare counter-attack

Emergency Maneuver:
- Press X for Emergency Stop (full stop + shield boost)
- Activates during evasion of torpedoes
- Gives brief invulnerability window
- Use to reposition and launch defensive craft


TIP 9: MISSION-SPECIFIC TACTICS
================================================================================

ATTACK MISSION OBJECTIVE:
- Scout enemy positions with Probe first
- Launch Fighter or Bomber ATTACK on primary target
- Support with Shuttle ATTACK or DEFENSE
- Concentrate fire to eliminate threats quickly
- Use Consumable: Energy Cells for final burst

DEFENSE MISSION OBJECTIVE:
- Protect specific ship/target/location
- Launch Shuttles/Fighters DEFENSE around target
- Create defensive perimeter 100+ pixels from target
- Expect enemy to attack - be ready
- Launch reinforcements as craft are damaged

SURVIVE MISSION OBJECTIVE:
- Launch DEFENSE craft preventatively
- Don't engage if not necessary
- Use Drones to jam enemy beams
- Keep shields above 50%
- Preserve consumables for endgame

DESTROY ALL ENEMIES:
- Scout with Probe to find all enemies
- Prioritize high-threat targets (Bombers first)
- Use ATTACK craft on priority targets
- Rotate craft to maintain pressure
- Use Energy Cells consumable at 50% enemy health

CAPTURE/TRANSPORT:
- Launch Shuttle TRANSPORT to target location
- Protect Shuttle with DEFENSE craft during delivery
- Expect enemy interference during transport
- Use WILD_WEASEL to distract enemy fire
- Focus main ship on protecting transport craft


TIP 10: ADAPTING TO FACTION STRENGTHS
================================================================================

VS. FEDERATION (Balanced, Torpedo-Heavy):
- Expect dual-arc torpedoes and strong beams
- Defend against missiles first (interrupt incoming)
- Use DEFENSE shuttles + Interceptors
- Drones can jam their beam weapons
- Fighter swarms effective vs. their light craft

VS. TRIGON (Disruptor-Heavy, Drone-Equipped):
- No traditional torpedoes - disruptors instead
- Disruptors fast but weak (0.5 damage each)
- Can launch Drones that jam YOUR beams
- Intercept their Drones immediately
- Use Bombers for heavy defense

VS. SCINTILIAN (Cloaked, Plasma Torpedo):
- Expect cloaking and slow, powerful plasma
- Use Probes to reveal cloaked positions
- Plasma is devastating - kill them fast
- Defensive craft essential vs. ambushes
- Fighters for quick strikes on cloaked enemies

VS. PIRATE (Unpredictable, Mixed Weapons):
- Hybrid designs - mixed beam/torpedo
- Less organized but still dangerous
- Standard tactics work well
- Focus on force concentration
- ATTACK craft very effective

================================================================================
APPENDIX: MISSION SYSTEM DESIGN NOTES
================================================================================

The shuttle system is built on a state machine architecture:

LAUNCH SEQUENCE:
1. Player presses KEY (1-6 with optional modifier)
2. InputManager detects key press
3. Engine.handleBaySystemInput() processes command
4. BaySystem determines craft type from modifiers
5. First Press: Cycle mission type, store in bayMissionState
6. Second Press: Launch craft via baySystem.launchCraft(mission)
7. Craft created at launch position (specific to craft type)
8. Craft added to entities array
9. Audio event triggered (launch sound)
10. Console message confirms launch

CRAFT LIFECYCLE:
1. Craft spawns at launch position
2. AI executes assigned mission
3. Craft takes damage from combat
4. If HP drops to 0, craft destroyed
5. BaySystem detects destruction
6. Bay space recovered when craft removed
7. Shuttle can land to repair
8. Fighter/Bomber/Drone destroyed when HP=0

MISSION STATE TRACKING:
- Separate state per craft type (Shuttle/Fighter/Bomber/Drone)
- Each has 6 slots (matching keyboard 1-6)
- First press: Sets mission, displays selection message
- Second press: Launches craft, clears state for next launch
- State resets after successful launch

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

Engine:
- handleBaySystemInput() processes all bay commands
- Located at lines 1917-2034 of Engine.js
- Updates happen every game frame
- InputManager detects single-frame key presses

BaySystem:
- launchShuttle(missionType)
- launchFighter()
- launchBomber()
- launchDrone(missionType)
- launchProbe(targetX, targetY)
- Each returns craft object or null if insufficient space

Craft AI:
- Each craft type extends Entity class
- Implements executeMission() method
- AI behavior varies by mission type
- Update() called every frame from BaySystem.update()

Event System:
- eventBus.emit('craft-launched', data)
- eventBus.emit('craft-destroyed', data)
- eventBus.on('shuttle-landed', handler)
- Mission system listens for probe/craft events
