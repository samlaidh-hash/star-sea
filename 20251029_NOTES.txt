enemy
ships not moving and not firing, beams not damaging enemy shipsor shields, torpedoes are damaging shields and
systems but do not appear to be damaging hull, lock-on is STILL not working
 
the console log says that lock-on was acquired but nothing visible happened and torps not appearing to home in,
  torps are also not originating from ship but from some distance away from hull

terrain needs fixing
