# STAR SEA - DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY PLAN
Date: 2025-10-04

=============================================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES (FIX IMMEDIATELY)
=============================================================================

1. ⚠️ WEAPON ALIGNMENT BUG
   Status: Debugging in progress
   Complexity: Medium - requires systematic debugging
   Time: 1-2 hours

   Action: Adding console logging to trace:
   - Mouse screen coordinates
   - World coordinates from screenToWorld()
   - Ship position and rotation
   - Firing point calculation
   - Beam endpoint calculation

   Next: User test with debug logging to identify exact issue

2. ⚠️ MINIMAP CIRCLES ARE ELLIPSES
   Status: Ready to fix
   Complexity: Low
   Time: 15 minutes

   Issue: Minimap rendering using non-circular aspect ratio

3. ⚠️ SHIP GRAPHIC - GALAXY CLASS
   Status: Need image reference
   Complexity: Low (once image provided)
   Time: 30 minutes

   Note: Cannot read uploaded image - need accessible file path

=============================================================================
HIGH PRIORITY (MEDIUM COMPLEXITY)
=============================================================================

4. ADD WEAPONS TO ALL SHIP CLASSES
   Status: System chart read
   Complexity: Medium
   Time: 2-3 hours

   Required:
   - FG: Forward Beam (systems chart shows this)
   - DD: Forward Beam + Forward/Aft Torpedo
   - CL: Forward Beam + Dual Torpedo
   - BC: 2x Forward Beam + Forward/Aft Torpedo + Aft Beam
   - Trigon ships: Disruptors per system chart
   - Scintilian ships: Pulse Beams + Plasma Torpedoes
   - Pirate ships: Mixed weapons
   - Space Stations: Per faction specifications

5. UPDATE WEAPON ARCS
   Status: Specifications received
   Complexity: Low
   Time: 1 hour

   - Trigon: Forward disruptors 120° arc, Aft disruptor (BC only) 120° aft
   - Space stations: Different arcs per faction

6. HUD REORGANIZATION
   Status: Specifications received
   Complexity: Low
   Time: 1 hour

   - Move weapon charge/loading info to systems block
   - Show only HP bars for weapons

=============================================================================
MAJOR NEW FEATURES (HIGH COMPLEXITY)
=============================================================================

7. SHUTTLE SYSTEM
   Status: Specifications received
   Complexity: VERY HIGH
   Time: 8-12 hours

   Components:
   - Shuttle entity class (shields, HP, beam weapon)
   - 5 mission types (Attack, Defense, Wild Weasel, Suicide, Transport)
   - AI for each mission type
   - Launch/recall system (M key)
   - Bay space management
   - UI for shuttle status

   This is essentially a mini-game system within the game.

8. TRACTOR BEAM SYSTEM
   Status: Specifications received
   Complexity: HIGH
   Time: 4-6 hours

   Components:
   - Target acquisition logic
   - Pin-in-place physics
   - Size-based targeting rules
   - Performance penalties (speed, shields, beams)
   - Q key toggle
   - Visual beam effect

9. BAY SYSTEM OVERHAUL
   Status: Specifications received
   Complexity: MEDIUM
   Time: 2-3 hours

   Required:
   - Space limits per ship class
   - Default loadouts
   - Space management UI

=============================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
=============================================================================

PHASE 1: Critical Bugs (Today)
-------------------------------
✓ Yellow line removed
✓ Ship outline updated (Galaxy-class)
✓ Pirate ship classes fixed
⚠️ Weapon alignment - DEBUG MODE (needs testing)
□ Minimap circles fix
□ Ship graphic refinement (pending image)

PHASE 2: Weapons & Balance (1-2 days)
--------------------------------------
□ Add weapons to all ship classes
□ Update weapon arcs
□ Space station weapons
□ HUD reorganization

PHASE 3: Major Features (3-5 days)
-----------------------------------
□ Bay system overhaul
□ Shuttle system (largest feature)
□ Tractor beam system

=============================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
=============================================================================

1. **Test weapon alignment with debug logging first**
   - This will help me identify the exact issue
   - Console will show all coordinates
   - We can then fix it properly

2. **Prioritize Phase 1 & 2 before Phase 3**
   - Get core game working perfectly first
   - Shuttles/tractor are major additions
   - Should be separate features, not bug fixes

3. **Shuttle system scope**
   - This is effectively adding a second game layer
   - Each mission type needs unique AI
   - Consider if all 5 mission types are needed initially
   - Could implement Attack/Defense first, add others later

4. **Ship graphic**
   - Need accessible image file
   - Or detailed description of desired changes
   - Current Galaxy-class has large saucer, nacelles, engineering hull

=============================================================================
IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
=============================================================================

1. Add weapon alignment debugging
2. Fix minimap circles
3. Test with user and get debug output
4. Fix weapon alignment based on findings
5. Add weapons to all ship classes
6. Then decide on shuttle system scope
