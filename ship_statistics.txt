=============================================================================
GAME MECHANICS
=============================================================================

Auto-Repair:
- All systems repair at 0.03 HP/second
- Repair stops if system reaches 0 HP
- Must be manually repaired (future feature) if destroyed

Shield Regeneration:
- 5 HP/second per quadrant
- 3 second delay after taking damage
- Quadrant-based damage distribution

Weapons Energy:
- Beams: Cooldown-based (time between shots)
- Torpedoes: Ammunition-based (reload time for full magazine)

Lock-On System (Torpedoes):
- Adaptive lock time: 3-5 seconds
  * 3 seconds with stable aim (< 20px/s reticle movement)
  * 5 seconds with unstable aim (> 100px/s movement)
- Lock loss: 2-3 seconds after reticle moves away
  * Faster loss the further away from target
- Visual: Green reticle (locking) → Red reticle (locked)

Movement:
- Forward/Reverse: W/S keys
- Turn: A/D keys
- 6 degrees of freedom in space
- Newtonian physics with thrust
