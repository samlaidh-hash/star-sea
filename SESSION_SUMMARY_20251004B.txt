# STAR SEA - SESSION SUMMARY
Date: 2025-10-04 (Afternoon Session)
Status: Critical Issues Addressed, Major Features Scoped

=============================================================================
COMPLETED THIS SESSION
=============================================================================

1. ✅ MINIMAP CIRCLES FIXED
   Problem: Circles appearing as ellipses
   Cause: Canvas element defaulting to 300x150 instead of 200x200
   Fix: Added width="200" height="200" to canvas element
   File: index.html line 145

2. ✅ WEAPON ALIGNMENT DEBUG LOGGING ADDED
   Problem: Weapons not hitting reticle center
   Solution: Added comprehensive debug logging (requires DEBUG_MODE: true)
   Shows: Mouse coords, world coords, ship position, beam endpoints
   File: js/core/Engine.js lines 542-565
   Next: User needs to test and provide console output

3. ✅ PRIORITY PLAN CREATED
   File: PRIORITY_PLAN.txt
   Breaks down all requested features by complexity and time

4. ✅ DEBUG GUIDE CREATED
   File: WEAPON_ALIGNMENT_DEBUG.txt
   Step-by-step instructions for debugging weapon alignment

=============================================================================
ISSUES REQUIRING USER ACTION
=============================================================================

1. ⚠️ WEAPON ALIGNMENT - NEEDS TESTING
   Action Required:
   - Open js/config.js
   - Set DEBUG_MODE: true
   - Start game and fire beams
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Copy console output and send to me

   This will reveal the EXACT nature of the misalignment

2. ⚠️ SHIP GRAPHIC - NEED IMAGE ACCESS
   You mentioned: "Why are you finding it so hard to use the outline of the 1701D graphic I uploaded?"
   Problem: I cannot access uploaded images through the file paths shown

   Solutions:
   a) Describe specific changes needed to current Galaxy-class shape
   b) Provide accessible file path (e.g., in project directory)
   c) Describe desired outline in text:
      - Saucer diameter relative to engineering hull
      - Nacelle length/width/position
      - Overall proportions

   Current Galaxy-class has:
   - Large elliptical saucer (75% ship width)
   - Smaller engineering hull
   - Wide nacelles positioned low

   What specifically needs to change?

=============================================================================
FEATURE REQUESTS RECEIVED
=============================================================================

### IMMEDIATE (Can do quickly - 1-2 hours each)
--------------------------------------------------

□ All ship class weapons (from system charts)
  - FG: Forward Beam
  - DD: Forward Beam + Dual Torpedo
  - CL: Forward Beam + Dual Torpedo
  - BC: 2x Forward Beam + Aft Beam + Torpedoes
  - Trigon: Disruptors (120° forward arc, BC has aft)
  - Scintilian: Pulse Beams + Plasma Torpedoes
  - Pirates: Mixed weapons (limited to 1 left-click + 1 right-click type)

□ Space Station Weapons
  - Federation: Fwd Beam + Fwd Torpedo + Aft Beam + Aft Torpedo
  - Trigon: 4 Disruptors (2 fwd 180°, 2 aft 180°)
  - Scintilian: 3 Pulse Beams (360°) + 1 Plasma Torpedo (360°)
  - Pirate: Fwd + Aft mounts (mixed weapons)

□ HUD Reorganization
  - Move weapon charge/loading info to systems block
  - Show only HP bars

### MEDIUM COMPLEXITY (2-4 hours)
--------------------------------------------------

□ Bay System Overhaul
  Space limits:
  - FG: 2 spaces
  - CL: 4 spaces
  - CA: 6 spaces
  - BC: 8 spaces

  Default loadouts:
  - FG: 1 Shuttle, 1 Decoy
  - CL: 2 Shuttles, 1 Decoy, 1 Mine
  - CA: 2 Shuttles, 2 Decoys, 2 Mines
  - BC: 3 Shuttles, 3 Decoys, 2 Mines

□ Tractor Beam System
  - Q key toggle
  - Locks mines/shuttles/torpedoes first
  - Then ships (size restricted - BC > CA > CL > FG)
  - 20% penalty to shields, beams, speed while active
  - Pins target in place relative to ship
  - Short range

### MAJOR FEATURES (8-12 hours each)
--------------------------------------------------

□ Shuttle System (LARGEST FEATURE)
  Components needed:
  - Shuttle entity class
  - Shields (3pt, recharge 1pt/s after 2s)
  - HP (2, explodes at 0)
  - Beam weapon (120° forward arc, 20% ship beam range)
  - Speed (50% of CA)
  - M key to cycle mission types
  - Long-press M to launch

  Mission Types (5 AIs needed):
  1. Attack - Move toward nearest enemy, engage
  2. Defense - Loiter near player, intercept torpedoes/shuttles, attack ships in range
  3. Wild Weasel - Fly away emitting torpedo-attracting signal
  4. Suicide - Ram nearest enemy, explode as 2 heavy torpedoes
  5. Transport - Scenario-specific (move to location, pause, return)

=============================================================================
QUESTIONS FOR YOU
=============================================================================

1. **Weapon Alignment:**
   Can you test with DEBUG_MODE and send console output?
   This is the quickest path to fixing it.

2. **Ship Graphic:**
   What specific changes do you want to the current Galaxy-class outline?

3. **Systems Implementation:**
   You asked: "Can you explain how you have implemented the systems chart?"

   Answer: Systems are damage boxes positioned based on grid layout in SystemDamageBoxes.js
   - Grid positions converted to pixel coordinates
   - Torpedo blast damage checks which boxes are hit
   - Each system has HP and can be disabled
   - Auto-repair at 0.03 HP/s

   Is there a specific aspect you want me to explain?

4. **Feature Priority:**
   Given the large scope, what should I prioritize?

   Recommended order:
   a) Fix weapon alignment (with your help via debug output)
   b) Add all ship class weapons
   c) Space station weapons
   d) Bay system overhaul
   e) Tractor beam
   f) Shuttle system (biggest, most complex)

5. **Shuttle System Scope:**
   Do you need all 5 mission types immediately, or can I implement Attack/Defense first?
   This would reduce initial dev time from 12 hours to ~6 hours.

=============================================================================
CURRENT GAME STATE
=============================================================================

Working:
✓ Yellow line removed
✓ Ship outline (Galaxy-class, may need refinement)
✓ Pirate ship classes fixed
✓ Lock-on system (adaptive timer, lock loss)
✓ Weapon energy bands (color coded)
✓ Reticle colors (green→red)
✓ Minimap circles (just fixed)

Needs Testing:
⚠️ Weapon alignment (debug logging ready)
⚠️ Enemy spawning (code correct, may be user flow issue)

Not Yet Implemented:
❌ Weapons for FG/DD/CL/BC/Stations
❌ Shuttle system
❌ Tractor beam
❌ Bay system update
❌ HUD reorganization

=============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
=============================================================================

Immediate (waiting on you):
1. Test weapon alignment with debug mode
2. Clarify ship graphic requirements
3. Confirm feature priority

Then I can:
1. Fix weapon alignment based on debug data
2. Add weapons to all ship classes (2-3 hours)
3. Implement space station weapons (1 hour)
4. Begin shuttle system or other prioritized feature

=============================================================================
TIME ESTIMATES
=============================================================================

Remaining Work:
- Weapon alignment fix: 1-2 hours (once debugged)
- All ship weapons: 2-3 hours
- Space station weapons: 1 hour
- HUD reorganization: 1 hour
- Bay system: 2-3 hours
- Tractor beam: 4-6 hours
- Shuttle system: 8-12 hours

Total: ~20-30 hours of development time

This is a significant expansion of the game's features. I can absolutely do it, but it will take time. Let me know what you'd like me to prioritize.
