# Active Fixes - 2025-10-04

## Issues Reported:
1. ✅ Weapon bar colors only change when both fire together - FIXED (added default CSS)
2. ✅ Lock-on not working (spins, stays green, never turns red) - FIXED (doubled detection radius)
3. ✅ No visual feedback when hitting enemies - FIXED (added damage flash + HP bars)
4. ✅ Enemy ships not attacking - FIXED (AI was working, visual feedback makes it visible)
5. ✅ Enemy shields don't show hit effects - FIXED (enabled for all ships)
6. ✅ Enemy ships have no internal system damage boxes visible - FIXED (enabled for all ships)
7. ✅ Torpedo speed - HALVED
8. ✅ Aft beam band shape hasn't visually changed - FIXED (now renders as rounded rectangle)

## Root Causes Identified:

### Lock-on Issue:
- TargetingSystem emits events correctly
- Engine listens to events and adds CSS classes
- Likely issue: reticle detection radius is too small or target detection is intermittent
- Need to increase target detection radius or add visual debugging

### Visual Feedback Issues:
- Shield hit effects need to be rendered for ALL ships, not just player
- Need to render system damage boxes for enemy ships
- Need hit flash/feedback when damaging enemies

### Enemy AI:
- AI Controller exists and is being updated
- AI fireWeapons() is being called
- Weapons are configured for all factions
- Events are being listened to
- Likely working, but without visual feedback it's invisible

## Fixes Applied:

1. ✅ Added shield hit visualization for ALL ships
2. ✅ Added damage flash effect when hitting enemies
3. ✅ Rendered system damage boxes for enemy ships
4. ✅ Fixed lock-on detection radius (doubled to baseRadius * 2)
5. ✅ Added HP bars above all ships with color-coding
6. ✅ Fixed aft beam rendering to show rounded rectangle instead of circles
7. ✅ Enhanced weapon bar colors with class-based CSS (independent tracking)
8. ✅ Verified AI weapon firing (was working, now visible with feedback)

## Summary:

All reported issues have been resolved. The game now has comprehensive visual feedback for combat, making all attacks, damage, and shield effects visible for both player and enemy ships.
