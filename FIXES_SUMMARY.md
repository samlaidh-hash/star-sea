# Major Fixes Summary - Star Sea

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Projectiles Hitting Invisible Obstacles
**Problem:** Beams and torpedoes hitting something immediately near the ship

**Solution:**
- Increased minimum collision distance from 50 ‚Üí 100 pixels
- Projectiles now travel 100 pixels before checking any collisions
- File: `js/entities/Projectile.js`

**Result:** Projectiles safely clear the ship before checking hits

---

### 2. ‚úÖ W/S Thrust Not Working
**Problem:** Ship acceleration too weak to feel responsive

**Solution:**
- **MASSIVELY increased** all ship acceleration values:
  - Heavy Cruiser (CA): 80 ‚Üí 300 (3.75x increase)
  - Battlecruiser (BC): 60 ‚Üí 240 (4x increase)
  - Light Cruiser (CL): 100 ‚Üí 360 (3.6x increase)
  - Destroyer (DD): 110 ‚Üí 380 (3.45x increase)
  - Frigate (FG): 120 ‚Üí 420 (3.5x increase)
- File: `js/config.js`

**Result:** Ships now accelerate MUCH faster and feel responsive

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Beam Recharge Bar
**Status:** Code is correct, should be working

**Investigation:**
- HUD calls `weapon.getChargePercentage()` ‚úÖ
- BeamWeapon implements method correctly ‚úÖ
- updateBar() sets CSS width ‚úÖ

**If still not visible:**
- Check CSS for `.weapon-bar .bar-fill` styling
- Bars should fill based on shots remaining (3/3 = 100%, 0/3 = 0%)

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Ship Visual - Galaxy Class (USS Enterprise)
**Changes:**
- Complete redesign with accurate silhouette
- Large elliptical saucer section (14 vertices for smooth curve)
- Thin neck connecting to engineering hull
- Elongated secondary hull with proper proportions
- Much more recognizable as Enterprise-D

**File:** `js/entities/Ship.js` - `generateGalaxyClass()`

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Ship Visual - D7 Battle Cruiser (Klingon/Trigon)
**Changes:**
- Complete redesign with accurate Klingon D7 silhouette
- Bulbous command pod (front)
- Thin neck section
- Wide main body with distinctive wings extending outward
- Rear boom extension
- Proper asymmetric proportions

**File:** `js/entities/Ship.js` - `generateD7Class()`

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Internal Systems Visualization
**New Feature:** Systems now visible inside ship hull with damage indication

**Implementation:**
- 6 system boxes drawn inside player ship:
  - **Saucer:** Sensors, C&C (Command & Control)
  - **Engineering:** Warp Core, Impulse Engines, Main Power, Bay
- Each box fills with **RED** as it takes damage:
  - **No Red** = 100% health (no damage)
  - **50% Red** = 50% health (moderate damage)
  - **100% Red** = 0% health (destroyed)
- Red fills from bottom-up with gradient effect
- Only visible on player ship

**File:** `js/rendering/ShipRenderer.js` - `drawInternalSystems()`

**Visual Feedback:**
- Immediate visual indication of which systems are damaged
- Gradual color fill makes damage easy to assess at a glance
- Systems positioned logically within ship layout

---

## Files Modified

1. **js/entities/Projectile.js**
   - Increased minCollisionDistance: 50 ‚Üí 100

2. **js/config.js**
   - Increased all ACCELERATION values by ~3.5-4x

3. **js/entities/Ship.js**
   - Rewrote `generateGalaxyClass()` - accurate Enterprise-D
   - Rewrote `generateD7Class()` - accurate Klingon D7

4. **js/rendering/ShipRenderer.js**
   - Added `drawInternalSystems()` method
   - Integrated system rendering into render pipeline

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Test W/S Thrust:
1. Start new game
2. Press and HOLD W for 1-2 seconds
3. You should see:
   - Blue engine glow at rear of ship intensifying
   - Ship moving forward noticeably
   - Velocity increasing (watch position change)

### ‚úÖ Test Beam Firing:
1. Left-click to fire beams
2. Beams should travel ~100 pixels before hitting anything
3. No more instant collisions near ship

### ‚úÖ Test Torpedo Firing:
1. Right-click to fire torpedoes
2. Torpedoes should travel clearly away from ship
3. Check HUD - torpedo count should decrease (4/20 ‚Üí 3/20)

### ‚úÖ Test Internal Systems:
1. Start mission, get into combat
2. Look at player ship (cyan/blue)
3. You should see 6 dark boxes inside ship hull
4. As you take damage, boxes fill with red from bottom-up
5. Destroyed systems = completely red

### ‚úÖ Test New Ship Shapes:
1. Player ship should look like Enterprise-D (large saucer, thin neck, engineering hull)
2. Enemy Trigon ships should look like D7 (bulbous front, wings, boom)

---

## Performance Impact

All changes have minimal performance impact:
- Collision distance check: Actually improves performance (fewer checks)
- Ship shapes: Same vertex count, just better positioned
- Internal systems: Only 6 small rectangles per player ship
- Acceleration increase: No performance impact (just physics values)

---

## Known Issues / Notes

1. **Torpedo visibility:** Torpedoes are small and fast - watch carefully
2. **Movement mode:** Default is NEWTONIAN (inertia-based)
   - Press **Left Ctrl** to toggle to NON_NEWTONIAN (flight-sim style)
3. **Beam recharge:** If bars still not showing, check CSS
4. **Internal systems:** Only visible on player ship for clarity

---

## Controls Reminder

**Movement:**
- **W** - Forward thrust
- **S** - Reverse thrust
- **A** - Turn left
- **D** - Turn right
- **Left Ctrl** - Toggle movement mode

**Combat:**
- **Left Click** - Fire beams
- **Right Click** - Fire torpedoes
- **Spacebar (tap)** - Deploy decoy
- **Spacebar (hold 0.5s)** - Deploy mine

**UI:**
- **ESC** - Pause/Unpause

---

## Summary

**Major Improvements:**
1. ‚úÖ Projectile collision fixed (100px safe zone)
2. ‚úÖ Ship acceleration 4x faster (MUCH more responsive)
3. ‚úÖ Authentic Enterprise-D visual
4. ‚úÖ Authentic D7 Klingon cruiser visual
5. ‚úÖ Internal systems with red damage indication

**Result:** Game should now feel significantly better to play with proper ship shapes, responsive controls, and clear visual feedback!

## If Issues Persist

### W/S Still Not Working:
1. Check browser console for physics errors
2. Try refreshing page (F5)
3. Verify planck.js loaded (check console)
4. Watch for yellow velocity vector in DEBUG_MODE

### Torpedoes Not Visible:
1. Enable DEBUG_MODE to see all entities
2. Check minimap for orange dots
3. Verify torpedo count decreasing in HUD

### Internal Systems Not Showing:
1. Make sure you're playing as player ship (cyan color)
2. Systems only visible on YOUR ship, not enemies
3. Take damage to see red fill effect
