## Work Completed

### 1. Lock-On System Overhaul
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Problems Identified:**
- Lock-on timer was fixed at 4 seconds regardless of aim quality
- Lock broke instantly when reticle moved off target
- Reticle turned red immediately when starting lock (should stay green until locked)
- Torpedo homing may not be receiving locked targets properly

**Files Modified:**
- `js/systems/TargetingSystem.js` - Major overhaul of lock-on logic
- `css/hud.css` - Reticle color states

**Implementation Details:**

#### A. Stability-Based Adaptive Lock Time
**New Constructor Properties:**
```javascript
this.minLockTime = 3;  // Stable aim
this.maxLockTime = 5;  // Unstable aim
this.currentLockTime = 4;  // Adaptive value
this.lastReticleX = 0;
this.lastReticleY = 0;
this.reticleMovementSpeed = 0;
```

**Algorithm:**
- Tracks reticle movement speed in pixels per second
- Movement < 20px/s → stable aim → 3 second lock
- Movement > 100px/s → unstable aim → 5 second lock
- Linear interpolation between extremes
- Calculation: `stabilityFactor = min(1, speed / 100)`
- Lock time: `minLockTime + (stabilityFactor * (maxLockTime - minLockTime))`

**Result:** Skilled players can lock faster with steady aim, poor aim takes longer

---

#### B. Time-Based Lock Loss with Distance Modifier
**New Constructor Properties:**
```javascript
this.lockLossProgress = 0;
this.lockLossTime = 2.5;  // Base time (2-3 seconds average)
this.isLosingLock = false;
```

**Algorithm:**
- Lock no longer breaks instantly when reticle moves off target
- Checks distance from reticle to locked target
- If within 3× drift tolerance (150px): gradual lock loss
- Lock loss rate scales with distance:
  - `distanceRatio = min(1, distance / (tolerance × 3))`
  - `lockLossRate = 0.5 + (distanceRatio × 1.5)` → 0.5× to 2.0× speed
- Closer to target = slower loss (up to 5 seconds)
- Further from target = faster loss (down to 1.25 seconds)
- If beyond 3× tolerance: instant break

**New Event:**
- `'lock-degrading'` - Emitted when lock starts degrading (for UI feedback)

**Result:** More forgiving lock-on that doesn't break instantly, feels more responsive

---

#### C. Reticle Visual States
**CSS Changes (hud.css):**

**Before:**
```css
#reticle.locking {
    border-color: #f00;  /* RED */
    animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
}
```

**After:**
```css
#reticle.locking {
    border-color: #0f0;  /* GREEN */
    animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
}
```

**Result:**
- Default: Green, no rotation
- Locking: Green, rotating slowly (2s)
- Locked: Red, rotating fast (1s)

**Behavior matches user specification:** "When it's over a target it should rotate then turn red when locked"

---

### 2. Weapon Energy Band Color Changes
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem Identified:**
Weapon energy bars (beams/torpedoes) weren't changing color to indicate charge state

**Files Modified:**
- `css/hud.css` - Added weapon bar state selectors

**Implementation:**
```css
/* Depleted (0%) - Red */
.weapon-bar .bar-fill[style*="width: 0%"],
.weapon-bar .bar-fill[style*="width: 0px"] {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #a00, #f00) !important;
}

/* Recharging (1-99%) - Yellow */
.weapon-bar .bar-fill:not([style*="width: 100%"]):not([style*="width: 0%"]):not([style*="width: 0px"]) {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #aa0, #ff0) !important;
}

/* Fully Charged (100%) - Green (default) */
.weapon-bar .bar-fill {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #0f0, #0a0) !important;
}
```

**Visual States:**
- **Green:** Weapon ready (100%)
- **Yellow:** Weapon recharging (1-99%)
- **Red:** Weapon depleted (0%)

**Result:** Clear visual feedback for weapon charge status

---

### 3. Shot Alignment - Beam Weapon Firing Points
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem Identified:**
Beams were firing from ship center instead of weapon emitter positions on hull

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// BeamWeapon.js - Line 49-53
calculateFiringPoint(ship, targetX, targetY) {
    // SIMPLIFIED: Just fire from ship center for now
    // TODO: Restore ellipse firing points once basic targeting works
    return { x: ship.x, y: ship.y };
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `js/components/weapons/BeamWeapon.js` - Restored proper firing point calculation

**Implementation:**

**New calculateFiringPoint() Method:**
1. Determines weapon type from `arcCenter`:
   - `arcCenter === 0` → Forward beam → uses `ship.weaponPoints.forwardBeamBand`
   - `arcCenter === 180` → Aft beam → uses `ship.weaponPoints.aftBeamPoint`
2. For ellipse bands (forward beams):
   - Calls `findNearestPointOnEllipse()` to find closest point on weapon band to target
   - Properly transforms from local ship coordinates to world coordinates
3. For point emitters (aft beams):
   - Transforms point from local to world space using ship rotation
4. Fallback to ship center if no weapon points defined

**Coordinate Transformation Math:**
```javascript
// Local to World transformation
const worldRad = MathUtils.toRadians(ship.rotation);
const worldCos = Math.cos(worldRad);
const worldSin = Math.sin(worldRad);
const worldX = ship.x + (localX * worldCos - localY * worldSin);
const worldY = ship.y + (localX * worldSin + localY * worldCos);
```

**findNearestPointOnEllipse() Algorithm:**
1. Convert target from world space to ship's local space
2. Calculate angle from ellipse center to target
3. Use polar equation to find radius at that angle
4. Calculate point on ellipse at that angle/radius
5. Transform point back to world coordinates

**Result:** Beams now fire from correct positions on ship hull, aligned with reticle

---

## Technical Notes

### Lock-On System Performance
- Movement tracking uses simple distance calculation (cheap)
- Lock loss only calculated when reticle is off target (conditional)
- No significant performance impact

### Coordinate Systems
Three coordinate systems used:
1. **Screen Space:** Mouse/reticle position (pixels from canvas top-left)
2. **World Space:** Game entities (camera-independent)
3. **Local Ship Space:** Positions relative to ship center/rotation

**Transformations:**
- Screen → World: `camera.screenToWorld(x, y)`
- Local → World: Rotation matrix + translation
- World → Local: Inverse rotation matrix + translation

### Weapon Points Structure
```javascript
ship.weaponPoints = {
    forwardBeamBand: {
        type: 'ellipse',
        centerX: 0,           // Local ship coordinates
        centerY: -size * 0.5,
        radiusX: size * 0.65,
        radiusY: size * 0.65,
        startAngle: 180,
        endAngle: 360,
        arcDegrees: 270
    },
    aftBeamPoint: { x: 0, y: size * 0.6 },
    forwardTorpedoPoint: { x: 0, y: -size * 0.3 },
    aftTorpedoPoint: { x: 0, y: size * 0.5 }
}
```

### Ellipse Polar Equation
For finding point on ellipse at angle θ:
```
r(θ) = (rx × ry) / sqrt((ry×cos(θ))² + (rx×sin(θ))²)

where:
  rx = radiusX
  ry = radiusY
  θ = angle from ellipse center to target
```

## Remaining Work / Testing Needed

### 1. Torpedo Homing - NEEDS TESTING
**Status:** Should be fixed
**Why:** TargetingSystem now properly tracks and provides locked targets to torpedoes. TorpedoProjectile.update() has correct homing logic.
**Test:** Fire torpedoes at locked target and verify they chase it.

### 2. Torpedo Fade Out - NEEDS VERIFICATION
**Status:** Likely already working
**Why:** Torpedoes have 4-second lifetime and no turn-back logic. They should expire naturally after missing.
**Test:** Fire torpedoes that miss and verify they fade out without turning around.

### 3. In-Game Testing Required
All fixes implemented based on code analysis. Need to:
- Start mission
- Test lock-on with stable aim (should lock in ~3 seconds)
- Test lock-on with unstable aim (should lock in ~5 seconds)
- Test lock loss by moving reticle away (should take 2-3 seconds)
- Verify reticle stays green while locking, turns red when locked
- Verify weapon bands turn yellow when recharging, red when depleted
- Verify beams hit where reticle points
- Verify torpedoes chase locked targets

## Bug Patterns & Prevention

### Pattern 1: Incomplete Feature Implementation
**Issue:** `calculateFiringPoint()` was simplified but never restored
**Lesson:** TODO comments in production code should be tracked and resolved
**Prevention:** Search for TODO comments before declaring features complete

### Pattern 2: User Experience vs. Technical Accuracy
**Issue:** Instant lock breaking felt unresponsive, even if technically "correct"
**Lesson:** Game feel trumps technical purity
**Prevention:** Consider player experience when implementing timing systems

### Pattern 3: Visual Feedback Missing
**Issue:** Weapon bars had no visual state indication
**Lesson:** Every system state should have visual feedback
**Prevention:** Add CSS states for all possible UI element states

### Pattern 4: Coordinate System Confusion
**Issue:** Firing points needed proper coordinate transformations
**Lesson:** Always be explicit about which coordinate system you're in
**Prevention:** Name variables clearly (worldX, localX, screenX) to avoid confusion

---

## Next Steps (If Continuing)

### Immediate:
1. Test all fixes in-browser
2. Adjust lock times if needed based on feel
3. Verify torpedo homing works correctly
4. Check for any edge cases or bugs

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Lock-on UI Feedback:**
   - Add progress bar showing lock-on progress (0-100%)
   - Add visual indication when lock is degrading
   - Add lock-on pip on HUD minimap

2. **Advanced Targeting:**
   - Cycle through multiple targets (Tab key)
   - Target lead indicators for moving targets
   - Target priority system (nearest, weakest, strongest)

3. **Torpedo Improvements:**
   - Add torpedo fuel system (runs out after distance)
   - Add torpedo ECM (electronic countermeasures resistance)
   - Add torpedo speed/damage trade-offs
