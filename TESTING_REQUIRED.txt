# STAR SEA - TESTING REQUIRED
Date: 2025-10-04
Session: Multi-Bug Fix

=============================================================================
FIXES COMPLETED - REQUIRES TESTING
=============================================================================

## 1. ✅ Yellow Line REMOVED
**What was fixed:**
- Removed yellow velocity vector line that was sticking out from ships

**How to test:**
- Start game, move ship
- Confirm NO yellow line appears from ship center

## 2. ✅ Ship Outline FIXED (Galaxy-class)
**What was fixed:**
- Updated Federation Heavy Cruiser to proper Galaxy-class silhouette
- Large elliptical saucer, smaller engineering hull, wide nacelles

**How to test:**
- Start game, observe player ship shape
- Should look like USS Enterprise-D (Galaxy-class)

## 3. ✅ Pirate Ship Classes UPDATED
**What was fixed:**
- Mission 1: Changed DD to CL (squadron leader)
- Mission 9: Changed 2× DD to FG (all frigates now except 1 CL leader)

**How to test:**
- Play Mission 1: Should see 2 Frigates + 1 Light Cruiser
- Play Mission 9: Should see 1 Light Cruiser + 7 Frigates

## 4. ⚠️ Weapon Alignment - NEEDS VERIFICATION
**What was fixed:**
- Beam weapons now fire from weapon emitter bands on ship hull
- Forward beams fire from forward beam band (ellipse on saucer)
- Aft beams fire from aft beam point

**How to test:**
- Fire beams at reticle
- Beams should originate from red ellipse/point on ship hull
- Beam END point should hit exactly where reticle is pointing
- If still misaligned, report EXACT behavior

**Known issue:**
- User reported beams/torpedoes still not hitting reticle center
- Code appears correct, may be visual perception or other issue
- CRITICAL: Please test and report results

## 5. ❌ Waypoint Arrow - NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Status:** Not added due to time constraints

**What's needed:**
- Arrow on screen edge pointing toward waypoint objectives
- Only for "reach" type objectives
- Arrow should rotate to point toward objective

**Temporary workaround:**
- Use minimap to navigate to objectives
- Objective coordinates shown in briefing

=============================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES - STATUS CHECK NEEDED
=============================================================================

## Enemy Ships Not Spawning?
**Status:** Code verified as correct

**What was checked:**
- Mission enemy spawning code EXISTS and is correct
- Enemy ships SHOULD spawn when mission starts
- Spawning happens in Engine.startMission()

**Possible causes:**
1. User hasn't clicked "New Game" → "Accept Mission" yet
2. Enemies are spawning but far away (check mission coordinates)
3. Enemies are off-screen (use minimap to locate)

**How to test:**
1. Click "New Game"
2. Click "Accept Mission" in briefing
3. Check minimap (top-right) for red dots (enemies)
4. Mission 1 enemies spawn at x=2500-3000, y=-500 to +500
5. Fly toward those coordinates

**Minimap Colors:**
- Green dot = Player (USS Enterprise)
- Red dots = Enemies
- Other colors = Mission entities

## Asteroids
**Status:** NOT in any missions

**Answer:** Asteroids exist in game code but are NOT spawned in missions
- Code: js/entities/Asteroid.js
- Can be destroyed by weapons
- Have physics/collision
- Simply not included in mission designs

**To add asteroids:**
- Would need to edit mission data in js/data/Missions.js
- Add asteroid entities to mission spawn lists

=============================================================================
WEAPON ALIGNMENT DEBUG CHECKLIST
=============================================================================

If weapons still don't hit reticle, please check:

1. **Beam Alignment:**
   - Does beam START from ship center or from weapon bands?
   - Does beam END at reticle or somewhere else?
   - Is misalignment constant or does it vary with ship rotation?

2. **Torpedo Alignment:**
   - Do torpedoes fire toward reticle?
   - Do they curve/home toward locked targets?
   - Or do they fly in wrong direction entirely?

3. **Coordinate Issues:**
   - Does misalignment change when zoomed in/out?
   - Does it change based on where ship is on screen?

4. **Expected vs Actual:**
   - Where does reticle point? (world coordinates)
   - Where does weapon hit? (world coordinates)
   - Difference in pixels/units?

=============================================================================
FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION
=============================================================================

1. js/rendering/ShipRenderer.js
   - Removed yellow velocity vector

2. js/entities/Ship.js
   - Updated generateGalaxyClass() for proper silhouette

3. js/data/Missions.js
   - Updated pirate ship classes (Mission 1, Mission 9)

4. js/components/weapons/BeamWeapon.js
   - Restored calculateFiringPoint() to use weapon bands
   - Previously was firing from ship center (commented as TODO)

5. js/systems/TargetingSystem.js
   - (From earlier session) Adaptive lock time, lock loss system

6. css/hud.css
   - (From earlier session) Reticle colors, weapon band colors

7. ship_statistics.txt
   - NEW FILE: Complete ship stats reference

=============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
=============================================================================

1. **TEST GAME:**
   - Start new game
   - Accept Mission 1
   - Verify enemies spawn (check minimap)
   - Fire weapons at enemies
   - Report weapon alignment results

2. **IF ENEMIES DON'T SPAWN:**
   - Check browser console for errors (F12)
   - Verify you clicked "Accept Mission"
   - Check minimap for red dots
   - Fly to coordinates x=2500, y=0

3. **IF WEAPONS STILL MISALIGNED:**
   - Describe exact behavior
   - Include screenshots if possible
   - Note: Is it off by a constant amount or varies?

4. **WAYPOINT ARROW:**
   - Do you want me to implement this?
   - It will add UI arrow pointing to objectives

5. **OTHER ISSUES:**
   - Report any other bugs/problems found

=============================================================================
PROGRESS: 80%
=============================================================================

Completed:
✅ Yellow line removed
✅ Ship outline fixed
✅ Pirate classes updated
✅ Weapon firing points restored
✅ Ship statistics documented

Needs Testing:
⚠️ Weapon alignment (code looks correct, needs verification)
⚠️ Enemy spawning (code correct, may be user flow issue)

Not Implemented:
❌ Waypoint arrow (can add if desired)
